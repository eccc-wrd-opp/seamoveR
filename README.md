This package is designed to facilitate archiving and maintaining ECCC waterbird tracking data on Movebank. It will include vignettes with step-by-step instructions for project creation and maintenance, as well as templates and guides to ensure standardization of column names and units. Functions will be included to process raw tracking data, generate a standard project README file, and summarize multiple projects into a single-species PDF report. 

You can install the main version of PelagicMagic from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

devtools::install_github("ecc-wrd-opp/seamoveR")
