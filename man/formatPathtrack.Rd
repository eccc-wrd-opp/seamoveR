\usage{
formatPathtrack(
  data.dir,
  outliers00 = T,
  out.dir = NULL,
  spcd = NULL,
  site = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.dir}{Filepath to the directory containing all Pathtrack downloads
to be re-formatted. Data can be organized in subfolders by tag-id (Pathtrack default)
or otherwise as they will be read recursively. Files that are not Pathtrack
ownloads should not be located in this directory.}

\item{outliers00}{If TRUE, labels all 0,0 coordinates as outliers
(hidden from Movebank map). If FALSE, no outliers are labeled and the user
must define outliers themselves prior to Movebank import. This is the preferred
behaviour if the user wishes to identify cases of burrow use (re-assign some
0,0 coordinates to the colony) prior labelling outliers.}

\item{out.dir}{Filepath to the directory in which to save .csv files of the
Movebank-formatted position data, and TDR data if applicable.}

\item{spcd}{Four-letter species code to use when generating the .csv filename
for the Movebank-formatted position data, and TDR data if applicable.}

\item{site}{Colony name/abbreviation (no spaces) to use when generating the
.csv filename for the Movebank-formatted position data, and TDR data if applicable.}
}
\value{
Returns an single object if only positional data are present, or a list
of two objects if both positional and time-depth data are present. If out.dir,
spcd, and site are specified, also saves Movebank-formatted data file(s) to
the location specified.

Prepare Pathtrack GPS(+TDR) data for import into Movebank
}
\details{
This function compiles the files obtained from Pathtrack GPS tracking
devices (.pos positional files and .txt TDR files) into a single file for
each data type, then reformats these files to comply with Movebank's required
field names and units.
